# A starter kit for the value investor

Being deeply curious about finances and the stock market since young, I thought it would be nice to compile a list of what resources I found valuable since I started investing myself.
  
Please note that some of these resources (brokers, for example) cater only to certain audiences since the author is based in Europe. Most of the resources will be universal.

That being said, let's jump right into it:

**BOOKS:**

- [The Intelligent Investor](https://amzn.eu/d/3zWjXRp) by Benjamin Graham

  The classic, the investing bible, wrote by the great Graham who mentored none other than the greatest investor of our era, Warren Buffet. Even though the book was firstly released some 75 years ago, a lot of it still remains highly relevant today. It should be kept in mind that the book is not aimed towards someone who is reading their first investing book.

- [One up on Wall Street](https://amzn.eu/d/7Cp9CH2) by Peter Lynch

  Peter Lynch is in the same tier as Buffet, a colossus of the game. He averaged a 29.2% annual return between 1977 and 1990. Enough of that, let's speak about the book. This is an excellent book for beginners, as Lynch speaks in an easy-to-understand way. It's not a proper technical book like The Intelligent Investor, but it expresses Lynch's philosophy of investing in things you are familiar with.

- [The Most Important Thing](https://amzn.eu/d/2ypMsvt) by Howard Marks

  Marks is a very important figure in risk management, something he's been doing for almost 30 years as founder of Oaktree Capital Management. Risk is not talked about enough but it is the most important thing (maybe you where thinking the title is about a big portion of pasta - I would understand). Actually, let's hear what Buffet says about that:  
  _"Rule No 1: never lose money. Rule No 2: never forget rule No 1."_

  The book is excellent even for rookies and besides risk, it stresses out the psychological aspect of investing and our reactions to market volatility. Maybe we are not made for investing as a species, after all.
