# A starter kit for the value investor

Being deeply curious about finances and the stock market since young, I thought it would be nice to compile a list of what resources I found valuable since I started investing myself.
  
Please note that some of these resources (brokers, for example) cater only to certain audiences since the author is based in Europe. Most of the resources will be universal.

That being said, let's jump right into it:

**BOOKS:**

- [The Intelligent Investor](https://amzn.eu/d/3zWjXRp) by Benjamin Graham

  The classic, the investing bible, wrote by the great Graham who mentored none other than the greatest investor of our era, Warren Buffet. Even though the book was firstly released some 75 years ago, a lot of it still remains highly relevant today. It should be kept in mind that the book is not aimed towards someone who is reading their first investing book.

- [One up on Wall Street](https://amzn.eu/d/7Cp9CH2) by Peter Lynch
